        <br>Value Proposition
        <br>
        <br> &nbsp; We are focus on creating brand value of Africa (its people and landscapes) and companies through the content we create on our expeditions with the help of our expeditionists and creative and educational volunteers that offsets paid advertising and investment into Expeditionists so we can support or African adventures, the causes we raise and the students and schools we support in the advancement of STEM Education in Africa. Our content targets audiences and brands that are aspire to travel, push their limits in adventure as individuals and achieving their own defining moment of greatness while creating an impact for African students, schools and adventurers in Africa. The international crowdsourcing of creative and educational talent for their skills brings in a return of value for Expeditionists in the creation of marketable content to package and sell to brands and companies in Africa and value for the volunteers is in the opportunities to be part of an expedition, on the ground or from home, where they can adventure landscapes with an expeditionist, or promote STEM Education in schools across Africa or adventure into artistic expression and be credited for it. Expeditionists allows people to become part of the expeditions in one way or another as if you were apart of the Red Bull team about climb a mountain or rush down a fast flowing river. Through our the creative team collaboration and volunteer program we call for people to find their inner adventurer or creative, and to achieve their own moments of greatness in exploration and artistic expression for the benefit of others in Africa. &nbsp; We also cater for brand Corporate Social Responsibility and Investment awareness, marketing and communications through our cause and content-based expeditions as well as offer opportunities to brands and corporations to invest in STEM education at schools in Africa and to be apart of expeditions as part of a team building and social solution initiative for companies. &nbsp; &nbsp;
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>Our Vision &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> To create a better image and life for Africa through supporting African heroes who undertake expeditions to raise awareness and funds for causes and produce marketable content that is packaged for commercial and educational purposes. With this content, STEM education is promoted among students and schools in Africa through accessible information and our volunteer program, thus advancing knowledge and skills development in a practical way. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> Core Values: &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> Expeditionists consists of three core principles: Explore, Educate and Empower. &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> Explore: &nbsp; We encourage people to explore their potential, mentally, physically and artistically to create a better world for Africans. In encouraging them, we support African expeditionists in their explorations of themselves and the world through mentorship, sponsorship, marketing and logistical and financial assistance. And we provide international volunteers with creative and educational opportunities to be apart these journeys exploring Africa and the world for a cause. As they explore, they create new content and solutions to better the lives of Africans. &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> Educate: &nbsp; As people explore themselves and the world, they educate themselves to a world of possibilities. Thus, we are passionate about education, especially the advancement of STEM education in Africa. We educate the public on issues facing Africa through our cause related expeditions that create large amounts of both commercial and educational content. In addition, by establishing creative collaborations between the expeditionists, international volunteers, brands and participating schools on our expeditions, our aim is to provide accessible interactive information and resources for African students and schools to advance their development in STEM education. With the exploration of the world, people become educated and aware of global issues. As we explore and educate ourselves of the world and the issues its faces, we journey towards self-discovery, a celebration of empowerment. &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> Empower: &nbsp; To empower, we strive to provide opportunities for celebrated journeys of exploration, education and impact in our content and structures of social development in Africa.
        <br> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunities for African expeditionists to further their education or careers in science, conservation, tourism, education and humanitarian development.
        <br> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunities for African students and schools to further their STEM education knowledge, skills and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunities for international volunteers to be apart of the expeditions as supporting adventurers or content producers, travel Africa, promote STEM education in schools across the continent and create a change within themselves as well as in the lives of Africans.
        <br> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunities for brands, companies and corporations to market themselves and their Corporate Social Responsibility and Investment initiatives through our epic content of heroic stories, narratives, people, feast and landscapes.
        <br> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunities for us to have an impact in the sustainability of African organizations, NGOs, and social enterprises by fundraising for them and creating awareness of the causes they advocate for. &nbsp; &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> How Expeditionists works &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> An African expeditionist (African as in a person who was born in Africa, lives in Africa and lives for Africa, no matter what race, ethnic group or class) takes on an expedition to raise funds for a certain cause, social enterprise or organization that promotes either conservation, education or human rights. During the expedition, the expeditionist collaborates with a volunteer creative team from a round the world to create innovative commercial and educational content. The commercial content is then edited into marketable content packages that are sold to brands, companies, corporations or sponsor for their own advertising and marketing purposes. A certain percentage of profits is then used in editing the educational content into informative and engaging content packages that are distributed on our website and social media platforms, Thoughbox, Mxit’s mobile education platform, radio stastions and television channels if possible. Participating students and schools can then can watch, listen, and interact with the content and expeditionists in real time on these distribution channels. Students will also get to interact with other students across the world on the listed platforms above in which they can discuss, debate and resolve the issues raised in relation to their curriculums. &nbsp;
        <br>
        <br> Through feedback data, we would like to take the best students from certain regions on field outings which they would not get at their schools and explore their STEM talents and passion with the help of tour/field guides and international volunteers. International volunteers provide a cash flow into the program to pay for the students and their field expeditions, however, international volunteers would also have to accommodate a local volunteer/s in an exchange of expedition&nbsp;and guiding&nbsp;skills.
        <br>
        <br> Once the expedition is completed, the funds raise for a certain organization, enterprise, cause or initiative are handed over and a monitoring and evaluation of how the funds are spent are conducted every 6 months until completion for a constant and transparent report. The expeditionist then may choose to become an ambassador to Expeditionists supporting new expeditionists on their journeys, giving awareness and motivational talks at schools, organizations, institutions and corporations and leading educational field trips in their region, with the assistance of international volunteers from the volunteer program, for schools and students who don’t have the resources to experience such thing. In addition, a book and documentary film of the expedition are produced with profits going to the expeditionist and the enterprise.</div>
